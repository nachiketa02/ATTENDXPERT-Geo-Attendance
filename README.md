Web & Android Based | GPS + Timetable Integrated Attendance System
Proudly Made in India 🇮🇳 | Supporting Digital India & Atmanirbhar Bharat

# Overview

- AttendXpert Geo-Attendance is a web and Android-based smart attendance system that marks attendance automatically based on a user’s live GPS coordinates and their assigned timetable.
The system verifies whether the employee or student is inside a designated location (geo-fence) and within their scheduled class or shift time before marking attendance.

- It’s a part of the AttendXpert Suite, designed to deliver affordable, intelligent, and locally developed digital attendance solutions for schools, colleges, and organizations across India.

 # Key Features

- Location-based Attendance: Marks attendance only within set GPS boundaries.

- Timetable Integration: Attendance linked to assigned class or shift schedules.

- Web + Android Support: Works on browsers and dedicated Android app.

- Admin Dashboard: Real-time analytics, reports, and user tracking.

- Cloud Database: Secure cloud storage for all records.

- Smart Notifications: Alerts for late arrivals, absentees, and out-of-zone users.

- Offline Mode: Saves attendance when offline and syncs automatically later.

# How It Works

- Admin creates organization, users, and their location boundaries (geo-fence).

- Timetables are uploaded or assigned to users via dashboard.

- User opens the AttendXpert Android app or web panel.

- When the user is inside the defined zone and within their schedule — attendance is auto-marked.

- Data syncs to cloud dashboard for admins to view reports.
